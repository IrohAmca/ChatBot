# Chatbot Project

This README file contains steps to help you create a chatbot using a small JSON dataset. This project aims to build an AI-based chatbot that responds to user inputs.

## Project Description

This project uses deep learning techniques to develop a chatbot that can generate appropriate responses to specific inputs. The bot understands user inputs and predicts certain intents to provide suitable responses.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (to create a deep learning model)
- JSON dataset (should include training data and responses)
- Virtualenv (optional, to create a virtual environment)

## Data Preparation

Create or obtain your JSON dataset. The dataset should include user inputs and the bot's responses to these inputs. An example JSON structure:

```json
{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "greeting",
            "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Good day"],
            "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there, how can I help you?"]
        }
        // Other intents and responses
    ]
}
```

Save your dataset in JSON format and keep this file in the root directory of your project.

## Model Creation and Training

1. Create a virtual environment (optional):

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install the necessary Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow # or pip install torch (if using PyTorch)
    ```

3. Write the code to create and train the model. These steps involve transforming your dataset to fit the model, training the model, and saving the results.

## Using the Chatbot

1. Load the trained model:

    ```python
    from tensorflow import keras # or import torch (if using PyTorch)
    
    model = keras.models.load_model('trained_model.h5') # Use the name of your trained model
    ```

2. Start a loop to use the chatbot and respond to user inputs.

## Project Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will have developed an AI model capable of responding to specific inputs by creating a chatbot. This bot can answer users' questions or provide information on specific topics.

## License

When using this project, be mindful of the dataset's and deep learning model's licenses.
